This alignment is crucial as it ensures targets are not only ambitious but also scientifically grounded to meet international climate goals. \u2013 Company-wide application: Targets apply Company-wide, across all significant scopes of emission \u2013 Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy), and pertinent categories within Scope 3 (other indirect emissions). This comprehensive approach encapsulates emissions from direct operational emissions to those from Nestl\u00e9\u2019s extended supply chain.

Water in agriculture Nestl\u00e9 has partnered with the University of Wageningen to identify key proxy metrics for the quantification of water benefits from selected agricultural practices, such as those found in the Nestl\u00e9 Agriculture Framework. The implementation of such practices can have positive impacts on local water resources. Regenerative agriculture practices, together with improved irrigation techniques and connected technologies, allow for water use reduction and increased water resilience. These practices are initially implemented and measured at farm level, with benefits expected to improve the overall watershed health as similar practices are implemented at larger scale.

The Purina Europe Ocean Restoration Program is focused on future supply chain resilience by helping to improve and restore the marine habitats which are critical for fish populations. Fish is part of Purina Europe\u2019s supply chain because it uses fish by-products. These are parts of fish that are not consumed by humans but provide a valuable ingredient in pet food, so that nothing goes to waste. Seagrass meadows, kelp forests and oyster reefs provide nursery grounds, shelter and food for many species, but they have been affected by overfishing, pollution and climate change and this is impacting the many species that rely on them.

Methodology For the calculation of waste generated in Nestl\u00e9 factories, waste for disposal is defined as any material that leaves a site and is destined for final disposal with no economic or ecological value. Conversely, any material diverted from the waste stream that results in a product with potential economic or ecological benefit is classified as a \u2018by-product\u2019. This KPI includes quantities of waste for disposal and by-products to give the total weight of waste generated from January to December. Waste and by-product data encompass both hazardous and non-hazardous waste streams. Furthermore, each factory is mandated by local regulations to classify and dispose of its own waste. Each factory reports hazardous and non-hazardous waste types (e.g. organic matter, food, cardboard), which are then consol",

Many of these supply chains are based in countries where water insecurity is high and access to sanitation and hygiene is low, especially in rural areas. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s contribution to improving access to WASH can help make a significant difference to the well- being and resilience of these farming communities. As such, respecting the right to WASH in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s own operations while seeking to address any adverse impacts to which it may contribute, or to which it may be linked through its business relationships, is deeply connected to achieving both Nestl\u00e9\u2019s water stewardship agenda and the Nestl\u00e9 Waters Pledge, as well as a key element of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s plans to support and accelerate the transition to a regenerative food system in a way that leaves no one behind.

In many parts of the world, this is a process that can take between 11 and 15 years (after high school) depending on licensing requirements and standards.

Our Net Zero Roadmap sets out our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity across all our sites by 2025. We also plan to adopt renewable thermal energy sources in our plants wherever feasible. In March 2023, we increased our renewables sourcing with a significant investment in a major new solar energy project in Texas, United States. The 600-hectare solar project, owned and developed by Enel North America, will add 208 MW of solar electricity to the U.S. grid. In addition to our direct investment, Nestl\u00e9 will purchase 100% of the renewable electricity attributes generated by the solar project\u2019s energy production for 15 years.

To have an ecosystem impact that can mitigate climate change, going beyond farm boundaries and working at a landscape level is required.

In drip irrigation, water is applied onto the soil at very low rates from a system of small-diameter pipes, Improving irrigation and water use resulting in targeted irrigation.

Creating Shared Value and Sustainability Report 2023 42Table of contents Packaging and circularity Performance We aim for a packaging system where no waste ends up in landfills or natural environments. To help deliver this, we are continuing to transform our packaging systems by reducing unnecessary materials and designing more efficient systems. We are also trialling fairer collection methods and supporting better regulation. By the end of 2023, 83.5% of our plastic packaging was designed for recycling.

Countries do not in general measure deforestation, and the FAO therefore calculate the national and global rates by measuring the net changes in forest area over time. This is composed of the land which is converted from forest and land which is converted to forest. However, defining deforestation is complicated by the fact that different countries define a \u201cforest\u201d in different ways, ranging up to 30% canopy cover, and as little as 0.05 ha, or as low as 2 m tree height. Further, it can be seen that a focus on a technical definition of deforestation, (moving from 11% canopy cover to 9% canopy cover) risks missing broader issues of forest degradation (e.g. moving from 100% canopy cover to 11% canopy cover) where the loss of forest values is arguably more important.

It will complement this with a commitment that its operations also do not lead to the loss of \u201cHigh Conservation Values\u201d (HCVs). In this way it will embrace a broader approach to deforestation and degradation. In implementing this commitment through its suppliers, Nestl\u00e9 will use national definitions of forests, or those agreed through stakeholder processes (e.g. RTRS) to help guide implementation.

Specifically, plantations may be removed (or not replanted after harvesting) in order to enhance overall conservation values of a landscape. Examples of this include removing trees from water courses to improve water conservation or deep peats. Whilst this would be classified as deforestation, such actions are permitted under FSC certification for the wider conservation and biodiversity benefits. Such forest areas would need to be FSC certified. Similarly in degraded forest landscapes with no remaining conservation value, there may be justification for limited conversion.
